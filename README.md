# Welcome!

I finished a DigitalCrafts bootcamp in early January, and am looking for a full-time role in web development.
Here you will find all the code I wrote for the bootcamp as well as my [personal website](https://abbeyperini.github.io/) and hobby projects.
You can also check out my [portfolio](https://abbeyperini.github.io/portfolio.html), [twitter](https://twitter.com/AbbeyPerini), and [blog](https://medium.com/@abbeyperini).
